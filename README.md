# PartSource Email Automation Challenge
This project was a personal exploration into using LangGraph for orchestrating LLM workflows in a multi-agent setup. The goal was to process and classify customer emails by complexity, sentiment, and topic, and automate responses where appropriate.

The solution combines simple rule-based logic with LLMs (GPT-3.5) and uses LangGraph to manage the flow between nodes. While there's a lot that could be improved—especially around training data, model fine-tuning, and scalability—the primary aim was to understand how LangGraph works in the context of multi-agent systems.

It’s a starting point, not a finished product.
